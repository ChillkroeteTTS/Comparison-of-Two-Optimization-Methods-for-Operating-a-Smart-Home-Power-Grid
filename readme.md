# Internship Report 
The code in this repo is not executbale because it depends on non public data and code.
Especially the code for the HAL algorithm is missing.

## Directory Overview
- hal: Should contain the HAL algorithm code as well as the simulation results from HAL.
- hal_plugin: Plugin written to transform an OEMOF energy system into a configuration executable by HAL. The directory also contains some example systems and code to plot the results.
- oemof_runs: Contains example energy systems. Will also contain simulation results performed with OEMOF.
- praktikumsbericht: LATEX code for the internship report and the report as *.pdf.
- result_data: Specific simulation results used for comparison of both algorithms in the internship report.
